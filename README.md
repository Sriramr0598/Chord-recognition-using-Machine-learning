# Chord-recognition-using-Machine-learning
In this project, the focus is on detection of chords by extracting chroma vectors as features from a Pitch Class Profile (PCP). In addition, it also proves that once this diversity is correctly handled by machine learning methods, chords form an adequate description for recognizing music.
The project has been implemented in python with trained models available in the repository
